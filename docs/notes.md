# Advent of Code 2024 Notes

These are my notes for each day's solutions.

## Day 1:


# TODOs
* Day 1
    * Part 1 - Do a comparison on the difference between using a `List<>` and an `int[]`
    * Part 2 - Should the arrays be sorted, or do something to handle previously discovered IDs?
* Day 3
    * Can I make the regexs any better, especially for Part 2?
